    <div class="fundalp">
        <p>The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You can
            use
            different types of flour if you want to experiment with whole wheat or buckwheat. And you can also add fruit
            to
            the mixture.
